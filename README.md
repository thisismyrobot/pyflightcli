# PyFlightCli

Some basic python-based command-line tools to interact with the BetaFlight
(and CleanFlight and RaceFlight and etc and etc) command line interface.

## Install

You need Python 3.6.

    python3 -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements

## Usage

To see commands:

    python pyflightcli.py

(Thank you python-fire!)

## Limitations

Only tested against Betaflight 3.1.7 so far.

## Errata

I've used "xFlight" to refer to all the similar version so I don't have to
list them all.
